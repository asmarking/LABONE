### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Austin  
 
I am a senior studying math and computer science at the **University of     California San Diego**. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like React.    

Skills:   
1. REACT    
2. JS    
3. JAVA    
4. C++    
5. C

My favorite language is c++, and my least favorite is java. I would be fine   with never typing `public static void main(String[] args)` again.     

> I am a big fan of themeparks, I mean who can resist the magic of disney.
